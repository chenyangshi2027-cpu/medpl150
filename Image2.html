    <h1>Image 1 – 5 × 7 Crop</h1>
    <p><a href="Images/PS_IMG_9905.jpg">Cropped photo 1920x1080</a></p>
    <p>
      This image was cropped to 5 × 7 inches. I chose this photo because it follows the leading line, which guides the viewer’s eyes through the hallway. The line clearly shows each classroom door along the way. This makes the composition more organized and easy to follow. It also gives the photo a sense of direction and depth.
