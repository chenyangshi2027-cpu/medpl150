    <h1> Shallow depth of field photo </h1>
    <img src="Images/shallow.jpg.jpg" alt="Shallow depth of field" photo="400" height="300">
    <p> This photo was taken with a low f-stop, which created a shallow depth of field. The focus is on the mouse, while the keyboard appears blurred in the background. This effect draws attention to the subject and gives the image a sense of depth.</p>
