    <h1> Deep depth of field photo </h1>
    <img src="Images/IMG_9610.JPG" alt="Deep depth of field" photo="400" height="300">
    <p> This photo was taken with a high f-stop, which produced a deep depth of field. As a result, both the foreground and background remain sharp, allowing more details across the entire scene to be clearly visible.</p>
