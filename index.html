    <h1> Ariel Shi's MEDPL 150 </h1>
    <h2> Creative Statement </h2>
    <p> I enjoy creating and exploring art that connects technology with the real world. My work draws from everyday photographs, which I recreate through programming. In this process, familiar images collide in new contexts, revealing unexpected possibilities.</p>
