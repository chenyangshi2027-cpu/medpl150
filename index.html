    <h1> Ariel Shi </h1>
    <p> Welcome to my MEDPL 150 chanel</p>
    <h2> Creative Statement </h2>
    <p> My name is Ariel Shi, and I enjoy creating and exploring art that connects technology with the real world. My work draws from everyday photographs, which I recreate through programming. 
      In this process, familiar images collide in new contexts, revealing unexpected possibilities.</p>

    <h2> Relfection </h2>
    <p> I think the biggest challenge in building a website is being careful with every line of code, because even one small mistake can cause problems. For me, the hardest part was adding links. 
      But through creating my first personal website, I learned how to start and finish a project. I hope to keep learning new skills to make my websites more rich and engaging.</p>
