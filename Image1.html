    <h1>Image 1 – 1920 × 1080 Crop</h1>
    <p><a href="Images/PS_IMG_9912.jpg"> Cropped photo 1920 x 1080 </a></p>
    <p>
      This image was cropped to 5 × 7 inches. I chose this photo because I thought the mirror made the shot more interesting. The reflection allowed me to include myself in the image in a natural way. This also added another layer to the picture, as it shows both the mirror and what is inside it. In this way, the photo shows how reflection can change the way we see an image.
